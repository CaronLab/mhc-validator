crap database created using OpenMS in this fashion:
- starting material: swiss prot saccharomyces cerevisiae fasta file
- created "targets" by generating a shuffled decoy database, enzyme=no digest, seed=1
	- No prefix attached, so they will look like targets
- created "decoy" by generating a reverse decoy database of the "fake target" database, enzyme=no digest, seed=1234
	- Given prefix of "rev_" so they will look like the decoy database
